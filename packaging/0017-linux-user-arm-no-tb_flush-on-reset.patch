Subject: linux-user: arm: no tb_flush on reset

When running automoc4 as linux-user guest program, it segfaults right after
it creates a thread. Bisecting pointed to commit a84fac1426 which introduces
tb_flush on reset.

So something in our thread creation is broken. But for now, let's revert the
change to at least get a working build again.
